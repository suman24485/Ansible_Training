To get the dictionary of all of the facts that are available for that particular host.
ansible -m setup hostname
Only gets the facts gathered by the setup module.
Gilles Cornu posted a template trick to list all variables for a specific host.
Template (later called dump_variables):
HOSTVARS (ANSIBLE GATHERED, group_vars, host_vars) :
{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname] | to_yaml }}
PLAYBOOK VARS:
{{ vars | to_yaml }}

Playbook to use it:
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - template:
      src: templates/dump_variables
      dest: /tmp/ansible_variables
  - fetch:
      src: /tmp/ansible_variables
      dest: "{{inventory_hostname}}_ansible_variables"
After that you have a dump of all variables on every host, and a copy of each text dump file on your local workstation in your tmp folder. If you don't want local copies, you can remove the fetch statement.

This includes gathered facts, host variables and group variables. Therefore you see ansible default variables like group_names, inventory_hostname, ansible_ssh_host and so on.
